# CoachifyMLModel
Working on creating an machine learning model for my business. All data analysed belongs to my company Coachify S覺nava Haz覺rl覺k. I will be observing and our spending habits and our customer feedbacks to determine what the relationship between our spending and customer growth is like.
# What is Coachify ?
Coachify is a mentorship platform started by me and a friend from Sabanc覺 University. We have mentors that work closely with their students. Our mentors are chosen from university students -usually freshman- who showed high success during YKS. We interview them and then train them to work with our customers who are made up of highschool students who want to succeed in YKS. Our primary source of marketing is on online social media platforms ( instagram, tiktok, youtube etc. ).

# Dataset
The dataset is in form of excel files. We have two main databases. The first one has all the spending we have done since 2023/07/19 and it is up to date. Some of our spending are paying our workers, advertisement costs, paying influencers for advertisements and etc. I also have another dataset that includes all of my customer information. Student information like what time of the year they started their subscription and what time did they leave, who did they work with etc. 

# Aim of My Project
I would like improve my understanding of customer habits and efficient spending. My main concern is looking for a correlation between advertisement spending and customer base growth. I want to compare all types of advertisements and see what the most cost effective is for my company. I also want to better visualize the datasets I have in order to make them easier to read and understand. My end goal is to create an interactive website where all of the information can be displayed in graphs etc.
